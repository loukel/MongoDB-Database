# MongoDB-Dictionary
Dictionary Collection for MongoDB Using Websters Dictionary (2009), Improved Version: POS have been replaced to full words, Where there are several words with the same meaning: string ("hamburger, burger") has been converted into an array (['hamburger', 'burger']). Current problem is that words are not primary IDs.
